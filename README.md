# CODEWAY
Machine Learning Internship

I have worked on the three projects in this one month of virtual internship from the CODEWAY organization. The detailed information of my projects are given below.

TASK 1 - Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.

TASK 2 - Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

TASK 3 - Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.
